# Arabic-Compiler
This project is a simple compiler for a custom Arabic-like programming language. It includes a lexer that tokenizes Arabic keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operators, a recursive descent parser that validates the program's syntax, and a semantic analyzer with multi-level scope and symbol table management to enforce variable declaration rules.
